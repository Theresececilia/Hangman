Hi Therese!

Jeepers, I never realise how stressful this game could be! You put a lot of pressure on the user!

Exceptional work. Usng things like map shows you really are diving dep and ave a great understading of the concepts.

11/10, Välgodkänt and very impressive.

If you handed this in as it is for Assignment 3 you'd almost have a VG for it, too! Moving the messages out of alerts and displaying them on screen is all you would need to do to have a VG.

CRITERIA FOR GRADING

*************************************

GODKÄNT:
-------------------------------------

Constant or let variable: ✅

Array: ✅
Consts with arrays are a personal choice. If the values will never change then it's fine for it to be a const (but for people like me it just doesn't feel right!)

Random selection from array: ✅
A better approach is to have the function return a value rather than "hardcoding" the variable inside the function
let answer = randomWord(); - this way it is reusable with other variables
An ever better way is to pass in the array as a parameter -
let answer = randomWord(DEADLY_SINS);  - this way it is reusabale with other variables and other arrays!

Loops:
  For: ✅

  While: N/A for this implementation

Comparison with user entered data: ✅

Final message: ✅
